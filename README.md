## Usage

##### Easy Way (shortcut)

Press the touch button on your controller (touchpad) to start recording and press it again to stop.

> NOTE: If you're using the touch button in the macro then disable it by going to Playback->Record On Touch

##### Manual Way

To record, click on `RECORD` button (Ctrl+R) to arm recording then press `PLAY` to start recording controls. The red text on the bottom right indicates the number of frames recorded. You can stop recording by clicking on `RECORD` button (Ctrl+R) again. The macro will then play the controls in a loop.

## Settings

You can create `settings.xml` and place it with the executable to override default settings.

| Setting | Description | Default
| --- | --- | --- |
| AutoInject | Automatically poll for PS4 Remote Play and inject whenever possible | false |
| EmulateController | Run with controller emulation (use without a controller) | false |
| ShowConsole | Open debugging console on launch | false |
| StartupFile | Absolute or relative path to the file to load on launch (can be xml or dll) | null |

##### Example settings.xml

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Settings>
  <AutoInject>true</AutoInject>
  <EmulateController>true</EmulateController>
  <ShowConsole>true</ShowConsole>
  <StartupFile>MyMacro.xml</StartupFile>
</Settings>
```

## Command Line Arguments

As of version 0.5.0, you can pass command line arguments to PS4Macro.exe and override the values in settings.xml. This allows you to create multiple shortcuts to PS4Macro.exe and have each of them override the settings when switching between games.

##### Example

`PS4Macro.exe --AutoInject --EmulateController --ShowConsole=false --StartupFile="C:\macro.xml"`

## Remapper

Remapper allows you to use your keyboard to control PS4 games with customizable key bindings. To use Remapper, go to Tools->Remapper and focus on PS4 Remote Play to control the game. Simply close the window to return to marco or script mode.

## Scripting

C# scripting support has been introduced in version 0.3.0 and later. This allows us to create custom behaviors beyond repeating macros with an easy-to-use API. The API also includes wrapped convenience functions such as pressing buttons, timing, and taking a screenshot from PS4 Remote Play. 

See the [scripting video tutorial](https://youtu.be/daCb97rbimA) to get started or see [the wiki](https://github.com/komefai/PS4Macro/wiki) for full documentation, examples, and other information.

NOTE: The script have to include a reference to `PS4MacroAPI.dll` to interface with PS4Macro. At the moment the scripts has to be compiled into a DLL file to be able to open with PS4 Macro.

##### Basic Example Script

This example script will press DPad up and wait one second, follow by pressing square. The loop repeats every 800ms.

```csharp
using PS4MacroAPI;

public class Script : ScriptBase
{
    /* Constructor */
    public Script()
    {
        Config.Name = "Example Script";
        Config.LoopDelay = 800;
    }

    // Called when the user pressed play
    public override void Start()
    {
        base.Start();
    }

    // Called every interval set by LoopDelay
    public override void Update()
    {
        Press(new DualShockState() { DPad_Up = true });
        Sleep(1000);
        Press(new DualShockState() { Square = true });
    }
}
```

## Troubleshoot

##### Macro not playing/recording

=> Disable AutoInject in settings.xml since some machines does not support AutoInject.

##### Visual Studio Build Error

=> Reinstall NuGet Package.

```
Update-Package â€“reinstall PS4RemotePlayInterceptor
```
